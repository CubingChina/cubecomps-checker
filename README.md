2. Type name or number to search a competitor.
3. Click on the competitor or type "Enter" to select it.
4. Check the results with score card. Click "Good" (shortcut "Y") or "Bad" (shortcut "N"). Double click on attempt or press shortcuts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to toggle the attempt as "Good"/"Bad". Once there's any "Bad" attempt, the "Good" action always acts as "Bad" for the result.
